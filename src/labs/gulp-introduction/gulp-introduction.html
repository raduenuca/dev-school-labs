                    Package managers simplify installing and updating project dependencies, which are libraries that an web application uses: Bootstrap, AngularJs, Polymer, everything that is used on your site and isn't written by you.

                    Browsing all the library websites, downloading and unpacking the archives, copying files into the projects â€” all of this is replaced with a few commands in the terminal.

        The Prependers

        Bio

        The Prependers are a quirky four-piece from Orlando, FL.
        Critics have hailed them as the greatest post-garage-rock

        They are currently writing a full length album that's a
        follow-up to their breakout 2011 album, Top Right Bottom Left,
        and their critically acclaimed EP, Opacity Zero.

                <h3>1.1 Marking Up Headings</h3>
                <p>We've been hired to create a home page for Open Source Records. They've only got two bands on their roster, but they are growing fast, so let's get started!</p>

                <h4>Task</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li>On this page, the record label's name - <strong>Open Source Records</strong> - is the most important content, so mark it up with the appropriate tag.</li>
                    <li>The name of the band - <strong>The Prependers</strong> - is the next most important content, so mark it up with the appropriate tag.</li>
                    <li>The section titles - <strong>Bio</strong>, <strong>Members</strong>, <strong>Albums</strong> and <strong>Tour Dates</strong> - are of lesser importance than the name of the band, so mark those up with the appropriate tags.</li>
                    <li>Mark the band's album names - <strong>Top, Right, Bottom, Left</strong>, and <strong>Opacity Zero</strong> - each with the <code>h4</code> tag.</li>
                    <li>Mark up the two paragraphs of the band's biography with the appropriate tags.</li>
                    <li>Mark up the band's tour message paragraph with the appropriate tag.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>1.2 Marking Up Lists</h3>
                <p>We just added the band members and song titles to the page. Decide the best tags to mark up that content, and don't forget to nest and indent tags when necessary!</p>

                <h4>Task</h4>

                <ol>
                    <li>Mark up the list of band members using the appropriate tag(s).</li>
                    <li>Mark up the song list for the album Opacity Zero using the appropriate tag(s).</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Exercise</h2>

                <p>Do your best to format the following HTML. Save it in a file called <code>regular-band.html</code></p>
